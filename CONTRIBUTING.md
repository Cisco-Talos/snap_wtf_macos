# How to Contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to WTF support for macOS! Here are a few general guidelines on contributing and
reporting bugs that we ask you to review. Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the contributors managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in
addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. In that spirit of mutual respect,
we endeavor to review incoming issues and pull requests within 10 days, and will close any lingering issues or pull
requests after 60 days of inactivity.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already reported or fixed by searching through our issues list.

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as
possible, and, if possible, a test case.
